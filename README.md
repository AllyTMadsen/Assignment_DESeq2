BF591 DESeq Project Assignment for RNAseq data

Major deliverables:
- Scatter / jitter plot of the DESeq2 normalized counts for the top ten significantly differentially expressed genes ranked by ascending padj
- Volcano plot (log2FoldChange vs. -log10(padj)) for all the genes discovered in the experiment
- Plotting the top ten positive NES and top ten negative NES pathways
